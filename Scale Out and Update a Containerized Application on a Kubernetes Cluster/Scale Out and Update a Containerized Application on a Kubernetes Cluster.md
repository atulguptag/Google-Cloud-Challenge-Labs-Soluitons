## `Lab Link` - [Click Here](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/1739?parent=catalog)

## YouTube Solution Link - To be Uploaded Soon

* Before starting this lab, we need to download and extract the source code of the application which is given in the lab instruction.

```
gsutil cp gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/echo-web-v2.tar.gz .
tar -xvf echo-web-v2.tar.gz
```

## Task 1: Build a echo-app:v2 tagged Docker Image & Push the image to the Google Container Registry

```
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/echo-app:v2 .
```

## Task 2: Deploy the echo-app:v2 application image to the Kubernetes Cluster

3.1 Connect to the previously created cluster so deployment of application

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials echo-cluster --zone us-central1-a --project $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
```

3.2 Deploy the sample application image, which we created in the previous step

```
kubectl create deployment echo-web --image=gcr.io/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/echo-app:v2
```

3.3 Expose your deployment by creating a service

```
kubectl expose deployment echo-web --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --target-port=8000
```

## Task 2: Scale your deployment to 2

```
kubectl scale deploy echo-web --replicas=2
```

## Task 4: Validate the application, It should working on v 2.0.0

```
kubectl port-forward service/echo-web 8080:80
```

After the above command, click on `web preview on port 8080` & you can see in your browser that it is showing `version: 2.0.0`
